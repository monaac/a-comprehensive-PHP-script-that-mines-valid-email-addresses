# a-comprehensive-PHP-script-that-mines-valid-email-addresses
 a comprehensive PHP script that mines valid email addresses from a given URL and saves the addresses as a text file:
 
 This script defines three functions: is_valid_email, extract_email_from_url, and save_email_addresses_to_file. The is_valid_email function works as described in my previous answers. The extract_email_from_url function uses the file_get_contents function to download the contents of the page at the given URL, and it uses the preg_match_all function and is_valid_email function to extract and validate email addresses from the page content, as described in my previous answers. The save_email_addresses_to_file function uses the fopen and fwrite functions to save the email addresses to a text file, with each email address on a separate line.
